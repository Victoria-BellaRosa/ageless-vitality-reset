          Why This Approach Actually Works: It's Not Just About What You Eat; It's About How Your Body Breathes

          When conventional medicine failed me, I turned to the science of chronic inflammation—
          and discovered the root cause of my suffering.

              The Inflammation Connection
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most people don't realize that chronic sinus issues, persistent headaches, brain fog, 
              and even balance problems often share a common root: <strong>systemic inflammation</strong>. 
              When your body is in a constant state of low-grade inflammation, your immune system 
              becomes hyperactive, attacking tissues it shouldn't and creating a cascade of symptoms 
              that seem unrelated but are deeply connected.

              The "Gentle Keto" Difference
            </h3>
            <p>
              Standard ketogenic diets are often too extreme—they create stress, are difficult to 
              maintain, and can actually increase inflammation in some people. My approach is different. 
              Drawing on my culinary expertise, I developed a <em>Gentle Keto Protocol</em> that:

              The Mind-Body Integration
            </h3>
            <p>
              Here's what my psychology background taught me: <strong>knowledge alone doesn't change 
              behavior</strong>. You can know exactly what to eat and still reach for the wrong foods. 
              That's why this protocol isn't just about what you eat—it's about rewiring your 
              relationship with food, stress, and your own body. It's about creating sustainable 
              change that sticks.
